PP_V3.ipynb and its variants: Iterative versions focusing on model refinement and evaluation.

Reports:

Final-Project-Report.pdf: Comprehensive documentation detailing methodologies, findings, and conclusions.

Visualizations:

actual_vs_predicted.png: Comparison between actual crime rates and model predictions.

crime_heatmap.png and crime_heatmap.html: Geospatial representation of crime intensity.

feature_importance_gb.png: Feature importance derived from Gradient Boosting model.

model_comparison.png: Performance comparison across different models.

monthly_crime_patterns.png: Temporal analysis of crime occurrences.

prediction_error_map.png and prediction_error_map.html: Spatial distribution of prediction errors.

Data Sources
The analysis is based on publicly available crime datasets, which include information such as:

Note: Specific details about the dataset, including its source and preprocessing steps, are documented within the notebooks.

Methodologies
The project employs several machine learning techniques to model and predict crime patterns:

Linear Regression: Establishes a baseline for prediction accuracy.

Ridge Regression: Addresses multicollinearity and prevents overfitting.

Gradient Boosting: Captures complex nonlinear relationships in the data.

Evaluation metrics used to assess model performance include:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R-squared (RÂ²) Score

Visualizations
To facilitate understanding and interpretation of the results, the project includes various visualizations:

Crime Heatmaps: Highlight areas with high crime density.

Prediction Maps: Visualize predicted crime hotspots.

Error Maps: Identify regions with significant prediction discrepancies.

Feature Importance Charts: Showcase the influence of different variables on crime prediction.

Ethical Considerations
While predictive policing offers potential benefits in crime prevention, it raises significant ethical concerns:
en.wikipedia.org

Bias and Discrimination: Models trained on historical data may perpetuate existing biases, leading to disproportionate targeting of certain communities.

Privacy Concerns: The use of personal and location data necessitates strict adherence to privacy regulations.

Transparency and Accountability: It's crucial to ensure that predictive models are interpretable and that their decisions can be audited.

Researchers and practitioners must approach predictive policing with caution, ensuring that ethical considerations are at the forefront of any implementation.
